# Automatic Report Generator

## Objective

The aim of this project is to develop an automatic report generator using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system will analyze and implement different stages of NLP to process text and generate reports.

## Scope

This project covers key stages of NLP:
- Text Preprocessing
- Corpus Analysis
- Report Generation

It demonstrates implementation using Python and relevant NLP libraries.

## Modules

### Module 1: Text Preprocessing
- **Objective:** Prepare text data for analysis.
- **Steps:**
  - **Tokenization:** Splitting text into sentences and words.
  - **Stop-word Removal:** Filtering out common, non-informative words.
  - **Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base or root form.

### Module 2: Corpus Analysis
- **Objective:** Extract meaningful insights from text data.
- **Steps:**
  - **Frequency Analysis:** Identifying common words and phrases.
  - **TF-IDF:** Measuring word importance in the text relative to a corpus.
  - **Sentiment Analysis:** Assessing the emotional tone of the text.

### Module 3: Report Generation
- **Objective:** Create a structured report based on analyzed text data.
- **Steps:**
  - **Summarization:** Generating a concise summary of the text.
  - **Template-based Report Generation:** Formatting the report using a predefined template.

### Module 4: Evaluation and Optimization
- **Objective:** Evaluate the quality of the generated report and optimize the generation process.
- **Steps:**
  - **Evaluation with BLEU and METEOR Scores:**
    - **BLEU Score:** Measures n-gram overlap; 1.0 indicates a perfect match.
    - **METEOR Score:** Assesses similarity with token matching and synonyms; close to 1.0 indicates high similarity.
  - **Optimization:** Improve accuracy and expand evaluation techniques.
